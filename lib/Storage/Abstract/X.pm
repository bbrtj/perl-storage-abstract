=head1 NAME

Storage::Abstract::X - Exceptions for Storage::Abstract

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	try {
		my $fh = $storage->retrieve('some/file');
	}
	catch ($e) {
		# $e is (usually) one of subclasses of Storage::Abstract::X
	}


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a small exception module for L<Storage::Abstract>. It can stringify
automatically and keeps a L</caller> and a L</message>.

=head2 Subclasses

=head3 NotFound

This exception is raised when a file is not found.

=head3 PathError

This exception is raised when a path passed in a method call is not well formed.

=head3 HandleError

This exception is raised when there is a problem with the handle passed to a
method call or created from data passed to a method call.

=head3 StorageError

This exception is raised when a problem occurs with the underlying file storage.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Attributes

=head3 message

B<Required> - Human-readable description of the problem.

=head3 caller

A three-element array as returned by C<caller> Perl function. The module will
try to find a caller most useful to the user - if it fails, this attribute will
be C<undef>.

It cannot be used in the constructor.

=head2 Methods

=head3 new

	$ex = Storage::Abstract::X::NotFound->new(%args)

Moose-flavored constructor.

=head3 raise

	Storage::Abstract::X::NotFound->raise($message)
	$ex->raise;

Same as calling C<< die $class->new(message => $message) >>. If there is no
C<$message> then it must be called on an object instance.

=head3 as_string

	$string = $ex->as_string()

Method used to stringify the exception.
