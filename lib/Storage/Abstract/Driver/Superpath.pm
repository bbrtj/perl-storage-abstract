=head1 NAME

Storage::Abstract::Driver::Superpath - Mount under directory metadriver

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# public file storage
	my $public_storage = Storage::Abstract->new(
		driver => 'directory',
		directory => '/some/directory',
	);

	# make public files visible under /public
	my $storage = Storage::Abstract->new(
		driver => 'superpath',
		source => $public_storage,
		superpath => 'public',
	);

	# these calls will return the same file
	my $fh1 = $public_storage->retrieve('/file');
	my $fh2 = $storage->retrieve('/public/file');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This metadriver does the opposite of L<Storage::Abstract::Driver::Subpath> - it
mounts its source driver under a passed L</superpath> directory. It will work
as if the entire filesystem was moved to that directory. Any file path must
have L</superpath> prepended to it explicitly in order to successfully target a
file.

=head1 CUSTOM INTERFACE

=head2 Attributes

=head3 source

B<Required> - A L<Storage::Abstract> instance. It can be coerced from a hash
reference, which will be used to call L<Storage::Abstract/new>.

=head3 superpath

B<Required> - A path prefix which will be added to all files in the L</source>
driver.

=head1 CAVEATS

This driver does not allow any file operation outside of L</superpath>. For
most operations it just means it will act as if the file was not present, but
for C<store> it will throw a C<Storage::Abstract::X::Readonly> instead (even
though the storage may not report being readonly). For this reason, it works
best when underlying storage is marked as C<readonly>.
