=head1 NAME

Storage::Abstract::Driver::Subpath - Change root metadriver

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# general file storage
	my $storage = Storage::Abstract->new(
		driver => 'directory',
		directory => '/some/directory',
	);

	# subpath of the file storage for public files
	my $public_storage = Storage::Abstract->new(
		driver => 'subpath',
		source => $storage,
		subpath => '/public',
	);

	# these calls will return the same file
	my $fh1 = $storage->retrieve('/public/file');
	my $fh2 = $public_storage->retrieve('/file');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This metadriver can modify another driver to use a different path than root. It
will work as if the root of the L</source> driver was changed to L</subpath>.
It does the opposite of L<Storage::Abstract::Driver::Superpath>.

It is impossible (as intended) to get files outside the L</subpath> using this
driver.

=head1 CUSTOM INTERFACE

=head2 Attributes

=head3 source

B<Required> - A L<Storage::Abstract> instance. It can be coerced from a hash
reference, which will be used to call L<Storage::Abstract/new>.

=head3 subpath

B<Required> - A path prefix for all paths passed to the L</source> driver.

=head1 CAVEATS

This driver caches the readonly state of its subdriver to make its behavior
consistent with other metadrivers. You can call C<refresh> to make it
recalculate the readonly state.
